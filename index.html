<p>We will sue on the following grounds:</p>

<p>-Google is breaking its own TOS by allowing people to sign up without credit card, waiting, locking them out and then requiring a credit card to regain access to the account -Google is acquiring confidential business information from business owners by locking out the owners and then allowing its own staff to access the information -Google is locking out Tor users systematically -The account recovery option is only accessible for people with a credit card -Google is acting discriminatory against people without credit cards in the US, Asia, Africa and South America</p>

<p>We will develop software also act as a information central for others who wish to set up class action suits against Google on other grounds. The website, tools and resources are being developed right now and supported by the open source community.</p>

<p>If a Google representative wishes to discuss this amicably then please send an e-mail and prove that I am wrong by helping me to regain access to my own account.</p>
